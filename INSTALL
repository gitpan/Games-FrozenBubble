                   [[ Frozen-Bubble ]]


                      Requirements


SDL_mixer >= 1.2.2
	http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

SDL perl >= 1.19.0 (tested successfully with 1.20.0, 1.20.3 and 2.1.2)
	http://sdl.perl.org/
        http://zarb.org/~gc/t/SDL_perl-1.20.0.tar.gz

SDL_Pango >= 0.1.2 with FB API patch
        http://sdlpango.sourceforge.net/
        http://zarb.org/~gc/t/SDL_Pango-0.1.2-API-adds.patch

The glib is needed for the server (and the server is needed for
easy automatic LAN games), either version 1 or 2.

The bzip2 and bzcat binaries are used to compress game records if
present, but FB can live without them.


===============================================================================

                Installation instructions
             to perform a system-wide install

E.g. if you want to manually install on your system, or perform
packagement of Frozen-Bubble.


[*] First, build Frozen-Bubble with GNU make; no arguments are
    needed, but you can provide the following optional arguments
    (listed from most wanted to least wanted):

    OPTIMIZE: args passed to the C compiler when compiling the
              Frozen-Bubble XS extension

    CFLAGS: args passed to the C compiler when compiling the
            server; warning, it needs the glib (either version 1
            or 2) so don't forget `glib-config --cflags` or
            `pkg-config glib-2.0 --cflags`

    LIBS: args passed to the compiler when linking the server;
          warning, it needs the glib (either version 1 or 2) so
          don't forget `glib-config --libs` or `pkg-config glib-2.0 --libs`

    PREFIX: the prefix used for DATADIR, LIBDIR, and BINDIR; by
            default /usr/local, distributions usually change that
            to /usr

    DATADIR: where non arch-dependant data are installed; by
             default $(PREFIX)/share

    LIBDIR: where arch-dependant data are installed; by default
            $(PREFIX)/lib
            
Example:

$ make PREFIX=/usr

Notice: as of SDL_Pango 0.1.2, the compiler may issue 5 warnings
"missing braces around initializer" from SDL_Pango.h; this is
normal because the SDL_Pango source is not fully correct, but
this should not create problems.


[*] Second, install the files on the system with GNU make with
    the argument "install". No more arguments are need, but you
    can provide the following optional arguments (listed from
    most wanted to least wanted):

    DESTDIR: a prefix inserted before DATADIR, LIBDIR, BINDIR,
             MANDIR and LOCALEDIR when actually installing data

    PREFIX, DATADIR, LIBDIR: same meaning as above; pay attention
             that DESTDIR is prepended if set so you don't need
             to start them with the destination directory

    BINDIR: where binaries are installed; by default $(PREFIX)/bin

    MANDIR: where manual pages are installed; by default $(DATADIR)/man

    LOCALEDIR: where internationalization files are installed; by
               default $(DATADIR)/locale

    ***IMPORTANT NOTICE***: if you've set any of PREFIX, DATADIR,
    or LIBDIR during the build process, you absolutely need to
    set them to the same values during install process.

Example:

$ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/fb-installroot PREFIX=/usr


===============================================================================

                    Installation instructions
             to install into a non standard directory

E.g. if you want to install in your homedir, /tmp, or if you want
to perform a parallel install of a more recent/development
version of Frozen-Bubble.


You need to specify the non-standard directory in the PREFIX
parameter; to make execution easier, you should also specify the
library directory where Perl modules will be installed, with
INSTALLSITELIB and INSTALLSITEARCH (INSTALLSITEARCH doesn't seem
to be needed everywhere though I don't know why).

Example:

$ make PREFIX=/tmp/frozen-bubble INSTALLSITELIB=/tmp/frozen-bubble/lib INSTALLSITEARCH=/tmp/frozen-bubble/lib

In the installation step, use the same PREFIX again:

$ make install PREFIX=/tmp/frozen-bubble

That's it; but then, when executing Frozen-Bubble, you have to
tell Perl where to find its modules, and where to find the *.mo
translation files:

$ PERL5LIB=/tmp/frozen-bubble/lib GETTEXT_DIRNAME=/tmp/frozen-bubble/share/locale /tmp/frozen-bubble/bin/frozen-bubble
