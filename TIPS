  During net/lan game choose, there is a chat system. Here are the
  available keys and tips:

- just type and hit enter to send a message

- page up and page down allow you to view history as in IRC
  programs

- arrow up and down allow you to recall previous messages you've
  sent

- the TAB key triggers nick completion on listening players

- in the pre-game chat, the following commands are available:

  - /me <action>: sends an action message instead of sending a
                  regular message 
  - /nick <new_nick>: change your nick
  - /server: query the name of the server you're connected to
  - /fs: toggle fullscreen
  - /list: view list of listening players
  - /geolocate: geolocate yourself again
  - /autokick <nick> [<text>]: add/remove that nick to autokick
    list

- in the in-game chat, the following commands are available:

  - /kick <nick> [<text>]: kick a joiner from your game (if you're
    creator), optionally with an explanatory text


  During a game, the following default key shortcuts are
  available:

TAB: next playlist music (if sound available and when playlist is used)
F11: toggle music
F12: toggle sound
Keypad Minus: lower music/sound volume
Keypad Plus: raise music/sound volume

  When in multiplayer with 3+ players:

F1: send malus to top left player
F2: send malus to top right player
F3: send malus to bottom left player
F4: send malus to bottom right player
F10: send malus to all opponents

Notice: you can see who you attack because the F1..F4 little text
next to the player turns white - you can see who is attacking by
the presence of the small pinguins of the opponent on the left of
your igloo.
