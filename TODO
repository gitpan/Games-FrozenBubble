- try to reduce cpu usage on end of network game, when waiting
- add dbus notifications

- There's no free-desktop desktop file in Frozen Bubble's package. When
  this file is used, Frozen Bubble shows up in the menus of any
  freedesktop compliant window manager (e.g KDE/GNOME). It would be nice
  to add one to the tarball. Since there's none, most distributions add
  its own. If there was a freedesktop file in the tarball, translations of
  the menu items would be centralized too.
  
  Here's the one used in the Pardus package (for an example) :
