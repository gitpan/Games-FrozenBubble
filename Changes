=item

full joystick support: just move your joystick(s) or
push buttons in the "change keys" dialog (analog
joysticks handled as digital for fair play)

when trying to used your joystick in Frozen-Bubble, if
nothing comes up, most probably your joystick isn't
configured correctly (or supported in Linux), use -ji
commandline switch to verify your joystick is detected
properly; if it is not, try to load the proper kernel modules
etc - for example, "joydev" is needed, but it is sometimes
not automatically loaded when plugging in a joystick (even in
modern distros and with USB joysticks)

=item

recording and playback of all games with non-predefined
levels (1-player in random and multiplayer training,
local 2-player, and network/LAN game with 2 to 5
players) - trigger a record by hitting the Print Screen
key during a game, or record all games by starting with
--auto-record

=item

realtime graphical effects in the menu screen (if your
computer is fast enough)
