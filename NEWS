What's new in version 2:

       - new 1-player game mode: multiplayer training; uses
         identical game rules as multiplayer, generated malus
         bubbles are counted as points

       - network (Internet) game: up to 5 players in a game (net
         game system has logic able to transparently handle
         players behind a NAT)

       - LAN game: similar to network game except that no
         connection to Internet is made, substituted by polling
         the local network

       - fully revamped graphics, including now 3d-based smooth
         penguin eyecandy
       
       - revamped intro and 1p music into fully digital productions

       - full joystick support: just move your joystick(s) or
         push buttons in the "change keys" dialog[1] (analog
         joysticks handled as digital for fair play)         

       - recording and playback of all games with non-predefined
         levels (1-player in random and multiplayer training,
         local 2-player, and network/LAN game with 2 to 5
         players) - trigger a record by hitting the Print Screen
         key during a game, or record all games by starting with
         --auto-record

       - realtime graphical effects in the menu screen (if your
         computer is fast enough)

       - anti-aliased+shaded+localized messages


Ref: 
[1] when trying to used your joystick in Frozen-Bubble, if
    nothing comes up, most probably your joystick isn't
    configured correctly (or supported in Linux), use -ji
    commandline switch to verify your joystick is detected
    properly; if it is not, try to load the proper kernel modules
    etc - for example, "joydev" is needed, but it is sometimes
    not automatically loaded when plugging in a joystick (even in
    modern distros and with USB joysticks)
